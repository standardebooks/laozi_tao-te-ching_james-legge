				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">體道</span>, "Embodying the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>." The author sets forth, as well as the difficulty of his subject would allow him, the nature of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> in itself, and its manifestation. To understand the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> one must be partaker of its nature.</p>
				    <p><cite><abbr>Par.</abbr> 3</cite> suggests the words of the apostle John, "He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love." Both the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ's</span> ideal in the absolute, and its <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tê</span>, or operation, are comprehended in his chapter, the latter being the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> with the name, the Mother of all things. [SEE PAGE 12, 13 IN THE TRODUCTION ON THE TRANSLATION OF THE TERM TAO.]<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-2" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">養牲</span>, "The Nourishment of the Person." But many of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung's</span> titles are more appropriate than this.</p>
				    <p>The chapter starts with instances of the antinomies, which suggest to the mind each of them the existence of its corresponding opposite; and the author finds in them an analogy to the "contraries" which characterize the operation of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, as stated in chapter 40. He then proceeds to describe the action of the sage in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 3</cite> as in accordance with this law of contraries; and, in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 4</cite>, that of heaven and earth, or what we may call nature, in the process of the vegetable world.</p>
				    <p><cite><abbr>Par.</abbr> 2</cite> should be rhymed, but I could not succeed to my satisfaction in the endeavour to rhyme it. Every one who can read Chinese will see that the first four members rhyme. The last two rhyme also, the concluding <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">隨</span> being pronounced so;&#8212;see the <cite><i epub:type="se.name.publication.book"><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kʻang-hsi</span> dictionary</i></cite> in <abbr>voc.</abbr><a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-2" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-3" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">安民</span>, "Keeping the People at Rest." The object of the chapter is to show that government according to the Tao is unfavourable to the spread of knowledge among the people, and would keep them rather in the state of primitive simplicity and ignorance, thereby securing their restfulness and universal good order. Such is the uniform teaching of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> and his great follower <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span>, and of all Taoist writers.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-4" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">無源</span>, "The Fountainless." There is nothing before the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>; it might seem to have been before God. And yet there is no demonstration by it of its presence and operation. It is like the emptiness of a vessel. The second character = <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">沖</span> = <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">盅</span>;&#8212;see <cite><i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kʻang-hsi</i></cite> on the latter. The practical lesson is, that in following the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> we must try to be like it.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-4" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-5" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">虛用</span>, "The Use of Emptiness." Quiet and unceasing is the operation of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, and effective is the rule of the sage in accordance with it.</p>
				    <p>The grass-dogs in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 1</cite> were made of straw tied up in the shape of dogs, and used in praying for rain; and afterwards, when the sacrifice was over, were thrown aside and left uncared for. Heaven and earth and the sages dealt so with all things and with the people; but the illustration does not seem a happy one. Both <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huai-nan</span> mention the grass-dogs. See especially the former, <cite><span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIV</span>, 25 a, b.</cite> In that Book there is fully developed the meaning of this chapter. The illustration in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</cite> is better. The Chinese bellows is difference to look at from ours, but the principle is the same in the construction of both. The <abbr>par.</abbr> concludes in a way that lends some countenance to the later Taoism's dealing with the breath.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-6" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">成象</span>, "The Completion of Material Forms." This title rightly expresses the import of this enigmatical chapter; but there is a foundation laid in it for the development of the later Taosim, which occupies itself with the prolongation of life by the management of the breath (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">氣</span>) or vital force.</p>
				    <p>"The valley" is used metaphorically as a symbol of "emptiness" or "vacancy;" and "the spirit of the valley" is the something invisible, yet almost personal, belonging to the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, which constitutes the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tê</span> (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">德</span>) in the name of our <em>King</em>. "The spirit of the valley" has come to be a name for the activity of the Tao in all the realm of its operation. "The female mystery" is the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> with a name of chapter 1, which is "the Mother of all things." All living beings have a father and mother. The processes of generation and production can hardly be imaged by us but by a recognition of this fact; and so <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> thought of the existing realm of nature&#8212;of life&#8212;as coming through an evolution (not a creation) from the primal air or breath, dividing into two, and thence appearing in the forms of things, material and immaterial. The chapter is found in <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lieh-tzŭ</span> (<cite><span epub:type="z3998:roman">I, <strong>I</strong></span> b</cite>) quoted by him from a book of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huang-ti</span>; and here <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> has appropriated it, and made it his own. [SEE THE INTRODUCTION, P. 2.]<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-6" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-7" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">韜光</span>, "Sheathing the Light." The chapter teaches that one's best good is realised by not thinking of it, or seeking for it. Heaven and earth afford a pattern to the sage, and the sage affords a pattern to all men.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-7" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-8" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">易性</span>, "The Placid and Contented Nature." Water, as an illustration of the way of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, is repeatedly employed by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span>.</p>
				    <p>The various forms of what is excellent in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</cite> are brought forward to set forth the more, by contrast, the excellence of the humility indicated in the acceptance of the lower place without striving to the contrary.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-9" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-9" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">運夷</span>; but I cannot give a satisfactory rendering of this title. The teaching of the chapter is, that fullness and complacency in success are contrary to the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>.</p>
				    <p>The first clauses of the two sentences in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 1</cite>, <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">持而盈之, 揣而銳之, 銳而揣之</span>, are instances of the "inverted" style not uncommon in the oldest composition. "The way of Heaven" = "the Heavenly <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>" exemplified by man.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-9" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-10" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">能爲</span>, "Possibilities." This chapter is one of the most difficult to understand and translate in the whole work. Even <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chu Hsi</span> was not able to explain the first member satisfactorily. The text of that member seems well supported; but I am persuaded the first clause of it is somehow corrupt.</p>
				    <p>The whole seems to tell what can be accomplished by one who is possessed of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>. In <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 3</cite> he appears free from all self-consciousness in what he does, and of all self-satisfaction in the results of his doing. The other two paragraphs seem to speak of what he can do under the guidance of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> for himself and for others. He can by his management of his vital breath bring his body to the state of Taoistic perfection, and keep his intelligent and animal souls from being separated, and he can rule men without purpose and effort. "The gates of heaven" in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</cite> is a Taoistic phrase for the nostrils as the organ of the breath;&#8212;see the commentary of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung</span>.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-10" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-11" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">無用</span>, "The Use of what has no Substantive Existence." The three illustrations serve to set forth the freedom of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> from all pre-occupation and purpose, and the use of what seems useless.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-11" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-12" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">檢欲</span>, "The Repression of the Desires." Government in accordance with the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> seeks to withdraw men from the attractions of what is external and pleasant to the senses and imagination, and to maintain the primitive simplicity of men's ways and manners. Compare <cite><abbr>chap.</abbr> 2.</cite> The five colours are Black, Red, Green or Blue, White, and Yellow; the five notes are those of the imperfect Chinese musical scale, our G, A, B, D, E; the five tastes are Salt, Bitter, Sour, Acrid, and Sweet.</p>
				    <p>I am not sure that <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wang Pi</span> has caught exactly the author's idea in the contrast between satisfying the belly and satisfying the eyes; but what he says is ingenious: "In satisfying the belly one nourishes himself; in gratifying the eyes he makes a slave of himself."<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-12" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-13" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">厭恥</span>, "Loathing Shame." The chapter is difficult to construe, and some disciples of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chu Hsi</span> had to ask him to explain it as the case of <cite><abbr>ch.</abbr> 10.</cite> His remarks on it are not to my mind satisfactory.; Its object seems to be to show that the cultivation of the person according to the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, is the best qualification for the highest offices, even for the government of the world. <cite><abbr>Par.</abbr> 3</cite> is found in <cite><i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</i> (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span>, 18 b)</cite> in a connexion which suggests this view of the chapter. It may be observed, however, that in him the position of the verbal characters in the two clauses of the paragraph is the reverse of that in the text of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung</span>, so that we can hardly accept the distinction of meaning of the two characters given in this commentary, but must take them as synonyms. Professor Gabelentz gives the following version of <i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuan-tzŭ</i>: "<i xml:lang="de">Darum, gebraucht er seine Person achtsam in der Verwaltung des Reiches, so mag man ihm die Reichsgewalt anvertrauen; ... liebend (schonend) ... übertragen</i>."<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-13" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-14" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">贊玄</span>, "The Manifestation of the Mystery." The subject of <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 1</cite> is the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, but the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> in its operation, and not the primal conception of it, as entirely distinct from things, which rises before the mind in the second paragraph. The Chinese characters which I have translated "the Equable," "the Inaudible," and "the Subtle," are now pronounced <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yi</i>, <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hsi</i>, and <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wei</i>, and in 1823 <span xml:lang="fr">Rémusat</span> fancied that they were intended to give the Hebrew tetragrammaton <span xml:lang="he">יהוה</span> which he thought had come to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> from the West, or been found by him there. It was a mere fancy or dream; and still more so is the recent attempt to revive the notion by Victor von Strauss in 1870, and Dr. Edkins in 1884. The idea of the latter is specially strange, maintaining, as he does, that we should read the characters according to their old sounds. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> has not in the chapter a personal Being before his mind, but the procedure of his mysterious <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, the course according to which the visible phenomena take place, incognisable by human sense and capable of only approximate description by terms appropriate to what is within the domain of sense. [SEE THE INTRODUCTION, PP. 14, 15.]<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-14" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-15" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">顯德</span>, "The Exhibition of the Quality," that is, of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, which has been set forth in the preceding chapter. Its practical outcome is here described in teh masters of it of old, who in their own weakness were yet strong in it, and in their humility were mighty to be co-workers with it for the good of the world.</p>
				    <p>The variety of the readings in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 4</cite> is considerable, but not so as to affect the meaning. The <abbr>par.</abbr> is found in <cite><i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huai-nan</i> (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">XII</span>, 23 a)</cite> with an unimportant variation. From the illustration to which it is subjoined he understood the fulness, evidently as in <cite><abbr>ch.</abbr> 9</cite>, as being that of a vessel filled to overflowing. Both here and there such fulness is used metaphorically of a man overfull of himself; and then <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> slides in another metaphor, that of a worn-out garment. The text of <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 3</cite> has been variously tampered with. I omit the <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">久</span> of the current copies, after the example of the editors of the great recension of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yung-lê</span> period (<abbr class="era">AD</abbr> 1403-1424) of the Ming dynasty.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-15" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-16" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">歸根</span>, "Returning to the Root." The chapter exhibits the operation of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> in nature, in man, and in government; an operation silent, but all-powerful; unaccompanied with any demonstration of its presence, but great in its results</p>
				    <p>An officer receives a charge of commission from his superior (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">受命</span>); when he reports the execution of it he is said <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">復命</span>. So all animate things, including men, receive their charge from the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> as to their life, and when they have fulfilled it they are represented as reporting that fulfilment; and the fulfilment and report are described as their unchanging rule, so that they are the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao's</span> impassive instruments, having no will or purpose of their own,&#8212;according to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ's</span> formula of "doing nothing yet doing all things (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">無爲而無不爲</span>)."<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-16" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-17" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">淳風</span>, "The Unadulterated Influence." The influence is that of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, as seen in the earliest and paradisiacal times. The two chapters that follow are closely connected with this, showing how the silent, passionless influence of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> was gradually and injuriously superseded by "the wisdom of the world," in the conduct of government. In the first sentence there is a small various reading of <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">不</span> for <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">下</span>, but it doe snot affect the meaning of the passage. The first clause of <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</cite> gives some difficulty; <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">其貴言</span>, "they made their words valuable or precious," <abbr>i.e.</abbr> "they seldom spake;" <cite><abbr>cp.</abbr> <strong><span epub:type="z3998:roman">i</span></strong><abbr>Sam.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">iii</span>. 1.</cite><a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-17" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-18" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">俗薄</span>, "The Decay of Manners." A sequel to the preceding chapter, and showing also how the general decay of manners afforded opportunity for the display of certain virtues by individuals. Observe "the Great <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>," occurring here for the first time as the designation of "the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>."<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-18" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-19" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">還淳</span>, "Returning to the Unadulterated Influence." The chapter desires a return to the simplicity of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, and shows how superior the result would be to that of the more developed systems of morals and government which had superseded it. IT is closely connected with the two chapters that precede. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ's</span> call for the renunciation of the methods of the sages and rulers in lieu of his fancied paradisiacal state is repeated ad nauseam by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span>.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-19" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-20" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">異俗</span>, "Being Different from Ordinary Men." The chapter sets forth the difference to external appearance which the pursuit and observance of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> produces between its votaries and others; and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> speaks in it as himself an example of the former. In the last three chapters he has been advocating the cause of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> against the learning and philosophy of the other school of thinkers in the country. Here he appears as having renounced learning, and found an end to the troubles and anxieties of his own mind; but at the expense of being misconceived and misrepresented by others. Hence the chapter has an autobiographical character.</p>
				    <p>Having stated the fact following the renunciation of learning, he proceeds to dwell upon the troubles of learning in the rest of <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 1</cite>. Until the votary of learning knows everything, he has no rest. But the instances which he adduces of this are not striking nor easily understood. I cannot throw any light on the four lines about the "yes" and the "yea."</p>
				    <p>Confucius (<cite><i epub:type="se.name:publication.book"><abbr>Ana.</abbr></i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVI, viii</span></cite>) specifies three things of which the superior man stands in awe; and these and others of a similar nature may have been the things which <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> had in his mind. The nursing-mother at the end is, no doubt, the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> in operation, "with a name," as in <cite><abbr>ch.</abbr> 1</cite>; "the mysterious virtue" of <cite>chapters 51 and 52</cite>.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-20" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-21" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">虛心</span>, "The Empty Heart." But I fail to see the applicability of the title. The subject of the chapter is the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> in its operation. This is the significance of the <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">德</span> in the first clause or line, and to render it by "virtue," as Julien and Chalmers do, only serves to hide the meaning. Julien, however, says that "the virtue is that of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>;" and he is right in taking <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">從</span>, the last character of the second line, as having the sense of "from," "the source from," and not , as Chalmers does, in the sense of "following."</p>
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ's</span> mind is occupied with a very difficult subject&#8212;to describe the production of material forms of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>; how or from what, he does not say. What I have rendered "semblances," Julien "<i xml:lang="fr">les images</i>," and Chalmers, "forms," seems, as the latter says, in some way to correspond to the "Eternal Ideas" of Plato in the Divine Mind. But <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> had no idea of "personality" in the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-21" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-22" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">益謙</span>, "The Increase granted to Humility." This title rightly expresses the subject-matter of the chapter. I cannot translate the first clause otherwise than I have done. It was an old saying, which <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> found and adopted. Whether it was intended to embrace all the cases which are mentioned may be questioned, but he employs it so as to make it do so.</p>
				    <p>"The emptiness" which becomes full is literally the hollowness of a cavity in the ground which is sure to be filled by overflowing water;&#8212;see <cite><i epub:type="se.name.publication.book">Mencius</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV, ii</span>, 18.</cite> "The worn out" is explained by the withered foliage of a tree, which comes out new and fresh in the next spring. I have taken the first sentence of <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</cite> as <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wu Chʻêng</span> does;&#8212;see his commentary in <abbr>loc.</abbr><a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-22" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-23" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">虛無</span>, "Absolute Vacancy." This, I think, is the meaning of the title, "Emptiness and Nothingness," as entire conformity to the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> in him who professes to be directed by it. Such a one will be omnipotent in his influence in all others. The <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tai</span> in him will restrain all (spasmodic) loquacity. Those who are described in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</cite> as "failing" are not to be thought of as bad men, men given up, as Julien has it, <i xml:lang="fr">au crime</i>. They are simply ordinary men, who have failed in their study of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> and practice of it, but are won to truth and virtue by the man whom the author has in mind.

				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">象玄</span>, "Representations of the Mystry." In this chapter <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span> approaches very near to give an answer to the questions as to what the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> is, and yet leaves the reader disappointed. He commences by calling it "a thing (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">物</span>);" but that term does not necessitate our regarding it as "material." We have seen in the preceding chapter that it is used to signify "spirits and men." Nor does his going on to speak of it as "chaotic (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">混成</span>)" necessarily lead us to conceive it as made up of the "material elements of things;" we have the same term applied in <cite><abbr>ch.</abbr> 14</cite> to the three immaterial constituents there said to be blended in the idea of it.</p>
				    <p>"He does not know its name," and he designates it by the term denoting a course of way (<span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">道</span>), and indicating the phenomenal attribute, the method in which all phenomena come before our observation, in their development or evolution. And to distinguish it from all other methods of evolution, he would call it "the Great Method," and so he employs that combination as its name in <cite><abbr>ch.</abbr> 18</cite> and elsewhere; but it cannot be said that this name has fully maintained it self in the writings of his followers. But understood thus, he here says, as in <cite><abbr>ch.</abbr> 1</cite>, that it is "the Mother of all things." And yet, when he says that "it was before Heaven and Earth were produced," he comes very near his affirmations in <cite>chapters 1</cite> and <cite>4</cite>, that "the nameless <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> was the beginning (or originating cause) of Heaven and Earth," and "might seem to have been before God." Was he groping after God if haply he might find Him? I think he was, and he gets so far as to conceive of Him as "the Uncaused Cause," but comes short of the idea of His personality. The other subordinate causes which he mentions all get their force or power from the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, but after all the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> is simply a spontaneity, evolving from itself, and not acting from a personal will, consciously in the direction of its own wisdom and love.

				    <p>The gist of the chapter is to be sought in the second paragraph, where we have two instances of the action of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> by contraries, supposed always to be for good.</p>
				    <p>But there is a difficulty in seeing the applicability to this cases mentioned in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 1</cite>. The first case, indeed is merely a natural phenomenon, having no moral character; but the others, as they have been illustrated from historical incidents, by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han Fei</span> and others at least, belong to schemes of selfish and unprincipled ambitious strategy, which it would be injurious to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> to suppose that he intented.</p>
				    <p><cite><abbr>Par.</abbr> 3</cite> is the most frequently quoted of all the passages in our <i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ching</i>, unless it be the first part of <cite><abbr>ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span></cite>. Fishes taken from the deep, and brought into shallow water, can be easily taken or killed; that is plain enough. "The sharp instruments of a state" are not its "weapons of war," nor its "treasures," nor its "instruments of government," that is, its rewards and punishments, though this last is the interpretation often put on them, and sustained by a foolish reference to an incident, real or coined, in teh history of the dukedom of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sung</span>. The <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">li chʻi</i> are "contrivances for gain," machines, and other methods to increase the wealth of a state, but, according to the principles of <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">Lao-tzŭ</span>, really injurious to it. These should not be shown to the people, whom the Taoistic system would keep in a state of primitive simplicity and ignorance. This interpretation is in accordance with the meaning of the characters, and with the general teaching of Taoism.

				    <p>The "virtue" is the activity or operation of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, which is supposed to have come out of its absoluteness.

				    <p>In <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 5</cite> we evidently have a resume of the preceding paragraphs, and, as it is historical, I translate them in the past tense; though what took place on the early stage of the world may also be said to go on taking place in the experience of every individual. With some considerable hesitation I have given the subjects in those paragraphs in the concrete, in deference to the authority of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung</span> and most other commentators. The former says, "By 'the highest <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">tê</i>' is to be understood the rulers of the greatest antiquity, without name or designation, whose virtue was great, and could not be surpassed." Most ingenious, and in accordance with the Taoistic system, is the manner in which <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wu Chʻêng</span> construes the passage, and I am surprised that it has not been generally accepted. By "the higher <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">tê</i> he understands, "the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>," that which is prior to and above the <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tê</i> (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">上德者, 在德之上, 道也</span>); by "the lower <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">tê</i>," benevolence, that which is after and below the <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tê</i> which is above benevolence; by "the higher righteousness," the benevolence which is above righteousness; and by "the higher propriety," the righteousness which is above propriety. Certainly in the summation of these four paragraphs which we have in the fifth, the subjects of them would appear to have been in the mind of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> as thus defined by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wu</span>.</p>
				    <p>In the reminder of the chapter he goes on to speak depreciatingly of ceremonies and knowledge, so that the whole chapter must be understood as descriptive of the process of decay and deterioration from the early time in which the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> and its attributes swayed the societies of men.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-38" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

And the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> affords that law by its passionless, undemonstrative nature, through which in its spontaneity, doing nothing for the sake of doing, it yet does all things.</p>
				    <p>The difficulty of translation is in the third paragraph. The way in which princes and kings speak depreciatingly of themselves in adduced as illustrating how they have indeed got the spirit of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>; and I accept the last epithet as given by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung</span>, "naveless" (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">轂</span>), instead of <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">穀</span> (= "the unworthy"), which is found in <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wang Pi</span>, and has been adopted by nearly all subsequent editors. To see its appropriateness here, we have only to refer back to <cite>chapter 11</cite>, where the thirty spokes, and the nave, empty to receive the axle, are spoken of, and it is shown how the usefulness of the carriage is derived from that emptiness of the nave. This also enables us to give a fair and consistent explanation of the difficult clause which follows, in which also I have followed the text of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung</span>.

				    <p>Who the sentence-makers were whose sayings are quoted we cannot tell, but it would have been strange if <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> had not had a large store of such sentences at this command.

				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">道化</span>, "The Transformations of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>." In <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</cite> we have the case of the depreciating epithets given to themselves by kings and princes, which we found before in <cite><abbr>ch.</abbr> 39</cite>, and a similar lesson is drawn from it. Such depreciation leads to exaltation, and the contrary course of self-exaltation leads to abasement. This latter case is stated emphatically in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 3</cite>, and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> says that it was the basis of his teaching. So far therefore we ahve in this chapter a repetition of the lesson that "the movement of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> is by contraries," and that its weakness is the sure precursor of strength. But the connexion between this lesson and what he says in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 1</cite> it is difficult to trace. Up to this time at least it has baffled myself. The passage seems to give us a cosmogony. "The <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> produced One." We have already seen that the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> is "The One." Are we to understand here that the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> and the One were one and the same? In this case what would be the significance of the <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">生</span> ("produced")?&#8212;that the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> which had been previously "non-existent" now became "existent," or capable of being named? This seem to be the view of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ssŭ-ma Kuang</span> (<abbr class="era">AD</abbr> 1009-1086).</p>
				    <p>The most singular form which this view assumes is in one of the treatises on our <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ching</span>, attributed to the Taoist patriarch <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lü</span> (<cite><span epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Hant">呂祖道德經解</span></cite>), that "the One is Heaven, which was formed by the congealing of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>." According to another treatise, also assigned to the same <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lü</span> (<cite><span epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Hant">道德真經合解</span></cite>), the One was "the primordial ether;" the Two, "the separation of that into its Yin and Yang constituents;" and the Three, "the production of heaven, earth, and man by these." In quoting the paragraph, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huai-nan Tzŭ</span> omits <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">道生一</span>, and commences with <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">一生二</span>, and his glossarist, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kao Yu</span>, makes out the One to be the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, the Two to be Spiritual Intelligences (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">神明</span>), and the Three to be the Harmonising Breath. From the mention of the Yin and Yang that follows, I believe that <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> intended by the Two these two qualities or elements in the primordial ether, which would be "the One." I dare not hazard a guess as to what "the Three" were.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-42" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				    <p>By "the softest thing in the world" it is agreed that we are to understand "water," which will wear away the hardest rocks.

The chapter is a lesson to men to judge of things according to their internal conviction of similar things in their own experience. Short as the chapter is, it is somewhat mystical. The phrase, "The <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>" or way of Heaven, occurs in it for the first time; and it is difficult to lay down its precise meaning. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> would seem to teach that man is a microcosm; and that, if he understand the movements of his own mind, he can understand the movements of all other minds.

				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chiao Hung</span> commences his quotations of commentary on this chapter with the following <span xml:lang="sa">Kumārajīva</span> on the <cite>second <abbr>par.</abbr></cite>:&#8212;"He puts it away till he has forgetten all that was bad in it. He then puts away all that is fine about him. He does so till he has forgetten all that was good in it. but the bad was wrong, and the good is right. Having diminished the wrong, and also diminished the right, the process is carried on till they are both forgotten. Passion and desire are both cut off; and his virtue and the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> are in such union that he does nothing; but though he does nothing, he allows all things to do their own doing, and all things are done." Such is a Buddhistic view of the passage, not very intelligible, and which I do not endorse.</p>
				    <p>In a passage in the <cite><i epub:type="se.name.publication.book">Narratives of the School</i> (<abbr>Bk.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span>, <abbr>Art.</abbr> 2)</cite>, we have a Confucian view of the passage:&#8212;"Let perspicacity, intelligence, shrewdness, and wisdom be guarded by stupidity, and the service of the possessor will affect the whole world; let them be guarded by complaisance, and his daring and strength will shake the age; let them be guarded by timidity, and his wealth will be all within the four seas; let them be guarded by humility, and there will be what we call the method of 'diminishing it, and diminishing it again.'" But neither do I endorse this.</p>
				    <p>My own view of the scope of the chapter has been given above in a few words. The greater part of it is found in <i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</i>.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-48" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">任德</span>, "The Quality of Indulgence."

				    <p>My version of <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 1</cite> is taken from <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Chalmers.

I must regard it as a sequel to the conversation between Confucius and some of his disciples about the principle (<span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao's</span> principle) that "Injury should be recompensed with Kindness," as recorded in the <cite><i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="xh-Latn-wadegile"><abbr>Con.</abbr> <abbr>Ana.</abbr></i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIV</span>, 36</cite>.

The views of the three disciples being thus different, they referred the point to the Master, who said, 'The words of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tzŭ-lu</span> are such as might be expected amoung the (wild tribes of) the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Man</span> and the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Mo</span>; those of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tzŭ-kung</span>, such as might be expected among friends; those of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hui</span>, such as might be expected among relatives and near connexions.'"

				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">歸元</span>, "Returning to the Source." The meaning of the chapter is obscure, and the commentators give little help in determining it.

It is the same thing or concept in both of its phases, the ideal or absolute, and the manifestation of it in its passionless doings. The old Jesuit translators render this <abbr>par.</abbr> by "<i xml:lang="la">Mundus principium et causam suam habet in Divino</i> <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">有</span> <i xml:lang="la">seu actione Divinae sapientiae quae dici potest ejus mater</i>."

				    <p><cite><abbr>Par.</abbr> 3</cite> seems to indicate the method of " guarding the mother in man," by watching over the breath, the proto-plastic "one" of <cite><abbr>ch.</abbr> 42</cite>, the ethereal matter out of which all material things were formed. The organs of this breath in man are the mouth and nostrils (nothing else should be understood here by <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">兌</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">門</span>;&#8212;see the explanations of the former in the last <abbr>par.</abbr> of the fifth of the appendixes to the <cite><span epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yi</span> in <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">xvi</span>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 432</cite>); and the management of the breath is the mystery of the esoteric Buddhism and Taoism.</p>
				    <p>In <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 4</cite> "The guarding what is soft" is derived from the used of "the soft lips" in hiding and preserving the hard and strong teeth.</p>
				    <p><cite><abbr>Par.</abbr> 5</cite> gives the gist of the chapter:&#8212;Man's always keeping before him the ideal of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, and, without purpose, simply doing whatever he finds to do; <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>-like and powerful in all his sphere of action.</p>

				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">修觀</span>, "The Cultivation (of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>), and the Observation (of its Effects)." The sentiment of the first paragraph is found in the twenty-seventh and other previous chapters&#8212;that the noiseless and imperceptible acting of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> is irresistible in its influence; and this runs through to the end of the chapter with the additional appeal to the influence of its effects. The introduction of the subject of sacrifices, a religious rite, though not presented to the Highest Object, will strike the reader as peculiar in our <i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ching</i>.</p>
				    <p>The <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tê</span> mentioned five times in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</cite> is the "virtue" of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> embodied in the individual, and extending from him in all the spheres of his occupation, and is explained differently by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han Fei</span> according to its application; and his example I have to some extent followed.</p>
				    <p>The force of <cite><abbr>pars.</abbr> 3</cite> and <cite>4</cite> is well given by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung</span>. On the first clause he says, "Take the person of one who cultivates the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">TaoL</span>, and compare it with that of one who does not cultivate it;&#8212;which is in a state of decay? and which is in a state of preservation?<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-54" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				    <p>With <cite><abbr>pars.</abbr> 1</cite> and <cite>2</cite>, compare what is said about the infant in <cite>chapters 10</cite> and <cite>20</cite>, and about the immunity from dangers such as here described of the disciples of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> in <cite><abbr>ch.</abbr> 50</cite>. My "evil" in the second triplet of <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 3</cite> has been translated by "felicity;" but a reference to the <i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kʻang-hsi</i> dictionary will show that the meaning which I give to <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">祥</span> is well authorised.

The third and fourth <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">曰</span> in this <abbr>par.</abbr> appear in <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung's</span> text as <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">日</span>, and he comments on the clauses accordingly; but <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">曰</span> is now the received reading.

				    <p>After the "weapons of war" in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 1</cite>, one is tempted to take "the sharp implements" in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</cite> as such wweapons, but the meaning which I finally adopted, especially after studying <cite>chapters 36</cite> and <cite>80</cite>, seems more consonant with <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-Tzŭ's</span> scheme of thought. In the last member of the same <abbr> par.</abbr>, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung</span> has the strange reading of <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">法物</span>, and uses it in his commentary; but the better text of <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">法令</span> is found both in <i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huai-nan</i> and <i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ssŭ-ma Chʻien</i>, and in <i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wang Pi</i>.</p>

				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">順化</span>, "Transformation according to Circumstances;" but this title does not throw light on the meaning of the chapter; nor are we helped to an understanding of it by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han Fei</span>, with his additions and comments (<cite><span epub:type="z3998:roman">XII</span>, 3b, 4b</cite>), nor by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huai-nan</span> with his illustrations (<cite><span epub:type="z3998:roman">XII</span>, 21 a, b</cite>). The difficulty of it is increased by its being separated form the preceding chapter of which it is really the sequel. It contrasts still further government by the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> with that by the method of correction. The sage is the same in both chapters, his character and government both marked by the opposites or contraries which distinguish the procedure of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> as stated in <cite><abbr>ch.</abbr> 40</cite>.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-58" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

The chapter shows how it is the guarding of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> that ensures a continuance of long life, with vigour and success. The abuse of it and other passages in our <i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ching</i> helped on, I must believe, the later Taoist dreams about the elixir vitae and life-preserving pills. The whole of it, with one or two various readings, is found in <cite><i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han Fei</i> (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span>, 4 b-6 a)</cite>, who speaks twice in his comments of <i epub:type="se.name.publication.book">The Book</i>.</p>
				    <p><cite><abbr>Par.</abbr> 1</cite> has been translated, "In governing men and in serving Heaven, there is nothing like moderation." But by "Heaven" there is not intended "the blue sky" above us, nor any personal Power above it, but the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> embodied in our constitution, the Heavenly element in our nature. The "moderation" is the opposite of what we call "living fast," "burning the candle at both ends."</p>
				    <p>In <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</cite> I must read <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">復</span>, instead of the more common <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">服</span>.

				    <p><cite><abbr>Par.</abbr> 1</cite>, that is, in the most quiet and easy manner. The whole of the chapter is given and commented on by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han Fei</span> (<cite><span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span>, 6 a-7 b</cite>); but very unsatisfactorily.</p>
				    <p>The more one thinks and reads about the rest oif the chapter the more does he agree with the words of Julien:&#8212;"It presents the frequent recurrence of the same characters, and appears as insignificant as it is unintelligible, if we give to the Chinese characters their ordinary meaning."&#8212;The reader will observe that we have here the second mention of spirits (the manes; <cite><i epub:type="se.name.publication.book">Chalmers</i></cite>, "the ghosts;" <i epub:type="se.name.publication.book">Julien</i>, <i xml:lang="fr">les démons</i>).

				    <p>Whatever <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> meant to teach in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</cite>, he laid in it a foundation for the superstition of the later and present Taoism about the spirits of the dead;&#8212;such as appeared a few years ago in the "tail-cutting" scare.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-60" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

In <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 1</cite> the clauses are indicative, and not imperative, and therefore we have to supplement the text in translating in some such way, as I have done. They give us a cluster of aphorisms illustrating the procedure of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> "by contraries," and conclude with one, which is the chief glory of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ's</span> teaching, though I must think that its value is somewhat diminished by the method in which he reaches it. It has not the prominence in the later teaching of Taoist writers which we should expect, nor is it found (so far as I know) in <cite><i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</i></cite>, <cite><i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han Fei</i></cite>, or <cite><i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huai-nan</i></cite>.
