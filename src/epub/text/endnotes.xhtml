				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">體道</span>, "Embodying the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>." The author sets forth, as well as the difficulty of his subject would allow him, the nature of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> in itself, and its manifestation. To understand the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> one must be partaker of its nature.</p>
				    <p><cite><abbr>Par.</abbr> 3</cite> suggests the words of the apostle John, "He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love." Both the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzu's</span> ideal in the absolute, and its <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Te</span>, or operation, are comprehended in his chapter, the latter being the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> with the name, the Mother of all things. [SEE PAGE 12, 13 IN THE TRODUCTION ON THE TRANSLATION OF THE TERM TAO.]<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-2" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">養牲</span>, "The Nourishment of the Person." But many of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung's</span> titles are more appropriate than this.</p>
				    <p>The chapter starts with instances of the antinomies, which suggest to the mind each of them the existence of its corresponding opposite; and the author finds in them an analogy to the "contraries" which characterize the operation of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, as stated in chapter 40. He then proceeds to describe the action of the sage in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 3</cite> as in accordance with this law of contraries; and, in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 4</cite>, that of heaven and earth, or what we may call nature, in the process of the vegetable world.</p>
				    <p><cite><abbr>Par.</abbr> 2</cite> should be rhymed, but I could not succeed to my satisfaction in the endeavour to rhyme it. Every one who can read Chinese will see that the first four members rhyme. The last two rhyme also, the concluding <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">隨</span> being pronounced so;&#8212;see the <cite><i epub:type="se.name.publication.book"><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">K'ang-hsi</span> dictionary</i></cite> in <abbr>voc.</abbr></p><a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-2" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-3" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">安民</span>, "Keeping the People at Rest." The object of the chapter is to show that government according to the Tao is unfavourable to the spread of knowledge among the people, and would keep them rather in the state of primitive simplicity and ignorance, thereby securing their restfulness and universal good order. Such is the uniform teaching of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzu</span> and his great follower <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzu</span>, and of all Taoist writers.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-4" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">無源</span>, "The Fountainless." There is nothing before the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>; it might seem to have been before God. And yet there is no demonstration by it of its presence and operation. It is like the emptiness of a vessel. The second character = <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">沖</span> = <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">盅</span>;&#8212;see <cite><i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Khang-hsi</i></cite> on the latter. The practical lesson is, that in following the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> we must try to be like it.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-4" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-5" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">虛用</span>, "The Use of Emptiness." Quiet and unceasing is the operation of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, and effective is the rule of the sage in accordance with it.</p>
				    <p>The grass-dogs in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 1</cite> were made of straw tied up in the shape of dogs, and used in praying for rain; and afterwards, when the sacrifice was over, were thrown aside and left uncared for. Heaven and earth and the sages dealt so with all things and with the people; but the illustration does not seem a happy one. Both <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzu</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huai-nan</span> mention the grass-dogs. See especially the former, <cite><span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIV</span>, 25 a, b.</cite> In that Book there is fully developed the meaning of this chapter. The illustration in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</cite> is better. The Chinese bellows is difference to look at from ours, but the principle is the same in the construction of both. The <abbr>par.</abbr> concludes in a way that lends some countenance to the later Taoism's dealing with the breath.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-6" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">成象</span>, "The Completion of Material Forms." This title rightly expresses the import of this enigmatical chapter; but there is a foundation laid in it for the development of the later Taosim, which occupies itself with the prolongation of life by the management of the breath (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">氣</span>) or vital force.</p>
				    <p>"The valley" is used metaphorically as a symbol of "emptiness" or "vacancy;" and "the spirit of the valley" is the something invisible, yet almost personal, belonging to the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, which constitutes the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Te</span> (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">德</span>) in the name of our <em>King</em>. "The spirit of the valley" has come to be a name for the activity of the Tao in all the realm of its operation. "The female mystery" is the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> with a name of chapter 1, which is "the Mother of all things." All living beings have a father and mother. The processes of generation and production can hardly be imaged by us but by a recognition of this fact; and so <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzu</span> thought of the existing realm of nature&#8212;of life&#8212;as coming through an evolution (not a creation) from the primal air or breath, dividing into two, and thence appearing in the forms of things, material and immaterial. The chapter is found in <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lieh-tzu</span> (<cite><span epub:type="z3998:roman">I, <strong>I</strong></span> b</cite>) quoted by him from a book of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huang-ti</span>; and here <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzu</span> has appropriated it, and made it his own. [SEE THE INTRODUCTION, P. 2.]<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-6" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-7" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">韜光</span>, "Sheathing the Light." The chapter teaches that one's best good is realised by not thinking of it, or seeking for it. Heaven and earth afford a pattern to the sage, and the sage affords a pattern to all men.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-7" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-8" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">易性</span>, "The Placid and Contented Nature." Water, as an illustration of the way of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, is repeatedly employed by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzu</span>.</p>
				    <p>The various forms of what is excellent in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</cite> are brought forward to set forth the more, by contrast, the excellence of the humility indicated in the acceptance of the lower place without striving to the contrary.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-9" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-9" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">運夷</span>; but I cannot give a satisfactory rendering of this title. The teaching of the chapter is, that fullness and complacency in success are contrary to the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>.</p>
				    <p>The first clauses of the two sentences in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 1</cite>, <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">持而盈之, 揣而銳之, 銳而揣之</span>, are instances of the "inverted" style not uncommon in the oldest composition. "The way of Heaven" = "the Heavenly <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>" exemplified by man.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-9" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-10" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">能爲</span>, "Possibilities." This chapter is one of the most difficult to understand and translate in the whole work. Even <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chu Hsi</span> was not able to explain the first member satisfactorily. The text of that member seems well supported; but I am persuaded the first clause of it is somehow corrupt.</p>
				    <p>The whole seems to tell what can be accomplished by one who is possessed of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>. In <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 3</cite> he appears free from all self-consciousness in what he does, and of all self-satisfaction in the results of his doing. The other two paragraphs seem to speak of what he can do under the guidance of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> for himself and for others. He can by his management of his vital breath bring his body to the state of Taoistic perfection, and keep his intelligent and animal souls from being separated, and he can rule men without purpose and effort. "The gates of heaven" in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</cite> is a Taoistic phrase for the nostrils as the organ of the breath;&#8212;see the commentary of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung</span>.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-10" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-11" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">無用</span>, "The Use of what has no Substantive Existence." The three illustrations serve to set forth the freedom of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> from all pre-occupation and purpose, and the use of what seems useless.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-11" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-12" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">檢欲</span>, "The Repression of the Desires." Government in accordance with the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> seeks to withdraw men from the attractions of what is external and pleasant to the senses and imagination, and to maintain the primitive simplicity of men's ways and manners. Compare <cite><abbr>chap.</abbr> 2.</cite> The five colours are Black, Red, Green or Blue, White, and Yellow; the five notes are those of the imperfect Chinese musical scale, our G, A, B, D, E; the five tastes are Salt, Bitter, Sour, Acrid, and Sweet.</p>
				    <p>I am not sure that <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wang Pi</span> has caught exactly the author's idea in the contrast between satisfying the belly and satisfying the eyes; but what he says is ingenious: "In satisfying the belly one nourishes himself; in gratifying the eyes he makes a slave of himself."<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-12" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-13" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">厭恥</span>, "Loathing Shame." The chapter is difficult to construe, and some disciples of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chu Hsi</span> had to ask him to explain it as the case of <cite><abbr>ch.</abbr> 10.</cite> His remarks on it are not to my mind satisfactory.; Its object seems to be to show that the cultivation of the person according to the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, is the best qualification for the highest offices, even for the government of the world. <cite><abbr>Par.</abbr> 3</cite> is found in <cite><i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-Tzu</i> (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span>, 18 b)</cite> in a connexion which suggests this view of the chapter. It may be observed, however, that in him the position of the verbal characters in the two clauses of the paragraph is the reverse of that in the text of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung</span>, so that we can hardly accept the distinction of meaning of the two characters given in this commentary, but must take them as synonyms. Professor Gabelentz gives the following version of <i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuan-tzu</i>: "<i xml:lang="de">Darum, gebraucht er seine Person achtsam in der Verwaltung des Reiches, so mag man ihm die Reichsgewalt anvertrauen; ... liebend (schonend) ... übertragen</i>."<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-13" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
