				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">體道</span>, "Embodying the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>." The author sets forth, as well as the difficulty of his subject would allow him, the nature of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> in itself, and its manifestation. To understand the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> one must be partaker of its nature.</p>
				    <p><cite><abbr>Par.</abbr> 3</cite> suggests the words of the apostle John, "He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love." Both the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ's</span> ideal in the absolute, and its <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tê</span>, or operation, are comprehended in his chapter, the latter being the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> with the name, the Mother of all things. [SEE PAGE 12, 13 IN THE TRODUCTION ON THE TRANSLATION OF THE TERM TAO.]<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-2" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">養牲</span>, "The Nourishment of the Person." But many of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung's</span> titles are more appropriate than this.</p>
				    <p>The chapter starts with instances of the antinomies, which suggest to the mind each of them the existence of its corresponding opposite; and the author finds in them an analogy to the "contraries" which characterize the operation of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, as stated in chapter 40. He then proceeds to describe the action of the sage in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 3</cite> as in accordance with this law of contraries; and, in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 4</cite>, that of heaven and earth, or what we may call nature, in the process of the vegetable world.</p>
				    <p><cite><abbr>Par.</abbr> 2</cite> should be rhymed, but I could not succeed to my satisfaction in the endeavour to rhyme it. Every one who can read Chinese will see that the first four members rhyme. The last two rhyme also, the concluding <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">隨</span> being pronounced so;&#8212;see the <cite><i epub:type="se.name.publication.book"><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kʻang-hsi</span> dictionary</i></cite> in <abbr>voc.</abbr><a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-2" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-3" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">安民</span>, "Keeping the People at Rest." The object of the chapter is to show that government according to the Tao is unfavourable to the spread of knowledge among the people, and would keep them rather in the state of primitive simplicity and ignorance, thereby securing their restfulness and universal good order. Such is the uniform teaching of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> and his great follower <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span>, and of all Taoist writers.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-4" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">無源</span>, "The Fountainless." There is nothing before the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>; it might seem to have been before God. And yet there is no demonstration by it of its presence and operation. It is like the emptiness of a vessel. The second character = <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">沖</span> = <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">盅</span>;&#8212;see <cite><i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kʻang-hsi</i></cite> on the latter. The practical lesson is, that in following the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> we must try to be like it.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-4" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-5" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">虛用</span>, "The Use of Emptiness." Quiet and unceasing is the operation of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, and effective is the rule of the sage in accordance with it.</p>
				    <p>The grass-dogs in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 1</cite> were made of straw tied up in the shape of dogs, and used in praying for rain; and afterwards, when the sacrifice was over, were thrown aside and left uncared for. Heaven and earth and the sages dealt so with all things and with the people; but the illustration does not seem a happy one. Both <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huai-nan</span> mention the grass-dogs. See especially the former, <cite><span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIV</span>, 25 a, b.</cite> In that Book there is fully developed the meaning of this chapter. The illustration in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</cite> is better. The Chinese bellows is difference to look at from ours, but the principle is the same in the construction of both. The <abbr>par.</abbr> concludes in a way that lends some countenance to the later Taoism's dealing with the breath.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-6" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">成象</span>, "The Completion of Material Forms." This title rightly expresses the import of this enigmatical chapter; but there is a foundation laid in it for the development of the later Taosim, which occupies itself with the prolongation of life by the management of the breath (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">氣</span>) or vital force.</p>
				    <p>"The valley" is used metaphorically as a symbol of "emptiness" or "vacancy;" and "the spirit of the valley" is the something invisible, yet almost personal, belonging to the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, which constitutes the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tê</span> (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">德</span>) in the name of our <em>King</em>. "The spirit of the valley" has come to be a name for the activity of the Tao in all the realm of its operation. "The female mystery" is the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> with a name of chapter 1, which is "the Mother of all things." All living beings have a father and mother. The processes of generation and production can hardly be imaged by us but by a recognition of this fact; and so <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> thought of the existing realm of nature&#8212;of life&#8212;as coming through an evolution (not a creation) from the primal air or breath, dividing into two, and thence appearing in the forms of things, material and immaterial. The chapter is found in <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lieh-tzŭ</span> (<cite><span epub:type="z3998:roman">I, <strong>I</strong></span> b</cite>) quoted by him from a book of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huang-ti</span>; and here <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> has appropriated it, and made it his own. [SEE THE INTRODUCTION, P. 2.]<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-6" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-7" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">韜光</span>, "Sheathing the Light." The chapter teaches that one's best good is realised by not thinking of it, or seeking for it. Heaven and earth afford a pattern to the sage, and the sage affords a pattern to all men.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-7" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-8" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">易性</span>, "The Placid and Contented Nature." Water, as an illustration of the way of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, is repeatedly employed by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span>.</p>
				    <p>The various forms of what is excellent in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</cite> are brought forward to set forth the more, by contrast, the excellence of the humility indicated in the acceptance of the lower place without striving to the contrary.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-9" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-9" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">運夷</span>; but I cannot give a satisfactory rendering of this title. The teaching of the chapter is, that fullness and complacency in success are contrary to the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>.</p>
				    <p>The first clauses of the two sentences in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 1</cite>, <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">持而盈之, 揣而銳之, 銳而揣之</span>, are instances of the "inverted" style not uncommon in the oldest composition. "The way of Heaven" = "the Heavenly <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>" exemplified by man.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-9" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-10" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">能爲</span>, "Possibilities." This chapter is one of the most difficult to understand and translate in the whole work. Even <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chu Hsi</span> was not able to explain the first member satisfactorily. The text of that member seems well supported; but I am persuaded the first clause of it is somehow corrupt.</p>
				    <p>The whole seems to tell what can be accomplished by one who is possessed of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>. In <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 3</cite> he appears free from all self-consciousness in what he does, and of all self-satisfaction in the results of his doing. The other two paragraphs seem to speak of what he can do under the guidance of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> for himself and for others. He can by his management of his vital breath bring his body to the state of Taoistic perfection, and keep his intelligent and animal souls from being separated, and he can rule men without purpose and effort. "The gates of heaven" in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</cite> is a Taoistic phrase for the nostrils as the organ of the breath;&#8212;see the commentary of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung</span>.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-10" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-11" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">無用</span>, "The Use of what has no Substantive Existence." The three illustrations serve to set forth the freedom of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> from all pre-occupation and purpose, and the use of what seems useless.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-11" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-12" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">檢欲</span>, "The Repression of the Desires." Government in accordance with the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> seeks to withdraw men from the attractions of what is external and pleasant to the senses and imagination, and to maintain the primitive simplicity of men's ways and manners. Compare <cite><abbr>chap.</abbr> 2.</cite> The five colours are Black, Red, Green or Blue, White, and Yellow; the five notes are those of the imperfect Chinese musical scale, our G, A, B, D, E; the five tastes are Salt, Bitter, Sour, Acrid, and Sweet.</p>
				    <p>I am not sure that <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wang Pi</span> has caught exactly the author's idea in the contrast between satisfying the belly and satisfying the eyes; but what he says is ingenious: "In satisfying the belly one nourishes himself; in gratifying the eyes he makes a slave of himself."<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-12" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-13" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">厭恥</span>, "Loathing Shame." The chapter is difficult to construe, and some disciples of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chu Hsi</span> had to ask him to explain it as the case of <cite><abbr>ch.</abbr> 10.</cite> His remarks on it are not to my mind satisfactory.; Its object seems to be to show that the cultivation of the person according to the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, is the best qualification for the highest offices, even for the government of the world. <cite><abbr>Par.</abbr> 3</cite> is found in <cite><i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</i> (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span>, 18 b)</cite> in a connexion which suggests this view of the chapter. It may be observed, however, that in him the position of the verbal characters in the two clauses of the paragraph is the reverse of that in the text of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung</span>, so that we can hardly accept the distinction of meaning of the two characters given in this commentary, but must take them as synonyms. Professor Gabelentz gives the following version of <i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuan-tzŭ</i>: "<i xml:lang="de">Darum, gebraucht er seine Person achtsam in der Verwaltung des Reiches, so mag man ihm die Reichsgewalt anvertrauen; ... liebend (schonend) ... übertragen</i>."<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-13" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-14" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">贊玄</span>, "The Manifestation of the Mystery." The subject of <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 1</cite> is the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, but the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> in its operation, and not the primal conception of it, as entirely distinct from things, which rises before the mind in the second paragraph. The Chinese characters which I have translated "the Equable," "the Inaudible," and "the Subtle," are now pronounced <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yi</i>, <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hsi</i>, and <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wei</i>, and in 1823 <span xml:lang="fr">Rémusat</span> fancied that they were intended to give the Hebrew tetragrammaton <span xml:lang="he">יהוה</span> which he thought had come to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> from the West, or been found by him there. It was a mere fancy or dream; and still more so is the recent attempt to revive the notion by Victor von Strauss in 1870, and Dr. Edkins in 1884. The idea of the latter is specially strange, maintaining, as he does, that we should read the characters according to their old sounds. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> has not in the chapter a personal Being before his mind, but the procedure of his mysterious <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, the course according to which the visible phenomena take place, incognisable by human sense and capable of only approximate description by terms appropriate to what is within the domain of sense. [SEE THE INTRODUCTION, PP. 14, 15.]<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-14" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-15" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">顯德</span>, "The Exhibition of the Quality," that is, of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, which has been set forth in the preceding chapter. Its practical outcome is here described in teh masters of it of old, who in their own weakness were yet strong in it, and in their humility were mighty to be co-workers with it for the good of the world.</p>
				    <p>The variety of the readings in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 4</cite> is considerable, but not so as to affect the meaning. The <abbr>par.</abbr> is found in <cite><i epub:type="se.name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huai-nan</i> (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">XII</span>, 23 a)</cite> with an unimportant variation. From the illustration to which it is subjoined he understood the fulness, evidently as in <cite><abbr>ch.</abbr> 9</cite>, as being that of a vessel filled to overflowing. Both here and there such fulness is used metaphorically of a man overfull of himself; and then <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> slides in another metaphor, that of a worn-out garment. The text of <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 3</cite> has been variously tampered with. I omit the <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">久</span> of the current copies, after the example of the editors of the great recension of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yung-lê</span> period (<abbr class="era">AD</abbr> 1403-1424) of the Ming dynasty.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-15" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-16" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">歸根</span>, "Returning to the Root." The chapter exhibits the operation of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> in nature, in man, and in government; an operation silent, but all-powerful; unaccompanied with any demonstration of its presence, but great in its results</p>
				    <p>An officer receives a charge of commission from his superior (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">受命</span>); when he reports the execution of it he is said <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">復命</span>. So all animate things, including men, receive their charge from the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> as to their life, and when they have fulfilled it they are represented as reporting that fulfilment; and the fulfilment and report are described as their unchanging rule, so that they are the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao's</span> impassive instruments, having no will or purpose of their own,&#8212;according to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ's</span> formula of "doing nothing yet doing all things (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">無爲而無不爲</span>)."<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-16" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-17" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">淳風</span>, "The Unadulterated Influence." The influence is that of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, as seen in the earliest and paradisiacal times. The two chapters that follow are closely connected with this, showing how the silent, passionless influence of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> was gradually and injuriously superseded by "the wisdom of the world," in the conduct of government. In the first sentence there is a small various reading of <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">不</span> for <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">下</span>, but it doe snot affect the meaning of the passage. The first clause of <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</cite> gives some difficulty; <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">其貴言</span>, "they made their words valuable or precious," <abbr>i.e.</abbr> "they seldom spake;" <cite><abbr>cp.</abbr> <strong><span epub:type="z3998:roman">i</span></strong><abbr>Sam.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">iii</span>. 1.</cite><a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-17" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-18" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">俗薄</span>, "The Decay of Manners." A sequel to the preceding chapter, and showing also how the general decay of manners afforded opportunity for the display of certain virtues by individuals. Observe "the Great <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>," occurring here for the first time as the designation of "the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>."<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-18" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-19" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">還淳</span>, "Returning to the Unadulterated Influence." The chapter desires a return to the simplicity of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, and shows how superior the result would be to that of the more developed systems of morals and government which had superseded it. IT is closely connected with the two chapters that precede. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ's</span> call for the renunciation of the methods of the sages and rulers in lieu of his fancied paradisiacal state is repeated ad nauseam by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span>.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-19" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-20" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">異俗</span>, "Being Different from Ordinary Men." The chapter sets forth the difference to external appearance which the pursuit and observance of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> produces between its votaries and others; and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> speaks in it as himself an example of the former. In the last three chapters he has been advocating the cause of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> against the learning and philosophy of the other school of thinkers in the country. Here he appears as having renounced learning, and found an end to the troubles and anxieties of his own mind; but at the expense of being misconceived and misrepresented by others. Hence the chapter has an autobiographical character.</p>
				    <p>Having stated the fact following the renunciation of learning, he proceeds to dwell upon the troubles of learning in the rest of <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 1</cite>. Until the votary of learning knows everything, he has no rest. But the instances which he adduces of this are not striking nor easily understood. I cannot throw any light on the four lines about the "yes" and the "yea."</p>
				    <p>Confucius (<cite><i epub:type="se.name:publication.book"><abbr>Ana.</abbr></i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVI, viii</span></cite>) specifies three things of which the superior man stands in awe; and these and others of a similar nature may have been the things which <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> had in his mind. The nursing-mother at the end is, no doubt, the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> in operation, "with a name," as in <cite><abbr>ch.</abbr> 1</cite>; "the mysterious virtue" of <cite>chapters 51 and 52</cite>.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-20" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-21" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">虛心</span>, "The Empty Heart." But I fail to see the applicability of the title. The subject of the chapter is the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> in its operation. This is the significance of the <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">德</span> in the first clause or line, and to render it by "virtue," as Julien and Chalmers do, only serves to hide the meaning. Julien, however, says that "the virtue is that of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>;" and he is right in taking <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">從</span>, the last character of the second line, as having the sense of "from," "the source from," and not , as Chalmers does, in the sense of "following."</p>
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ's</span> mind is occupied with a very difficult subject&#8212;to describe the production of material forms of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>; how or from what, he does not say. What I have rendered "semblances," Julien "<i xml:lang="fr">les images</i>," and Chalmers, "forms," seems, as the latter says, in some way to correspond to the "Eternal Ideas" of Plato in the Divine Mind. But <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> had no idea of "personality" in the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>.<a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-21" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-22" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">益謙</span>, "The Increase granted to Humility." This title rightly expresses the subject-matter of the chapter. I cannot translate the first clause otherwise than I have done. It was an old saying, which <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> found and adopted. Whether it was intended to embrace all the cases which are mentioned may be questioned, but he employs it so as to make it do so.</p>
				    <p>"The emptiness" which becomes full is literally the hollowness of a cavity in the ground which is sure to be filled by overflowing water;&#8212;see <cite><i epub:type="se.name.publication.book">Mencius</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV, ii</span>, 18.</cite> "The worn out" is explained by the withered foliage of a tree, which comes out new and fresh in the next spring. I have taken the first sentence of <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</cite> as <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wu Chʻêng</span> does;&#8212;see his commentary in <abbr>loc.</abbr><a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-22" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-23" epub:type="endnote">
				    <p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">虛無</span>, "Absolute Vacancy." This, I think, is the meaning of the title, "Emptiness and Nothingness," as entire conformity to the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> in him who professes to be directed by it. Such a one will be omnipotent in his influence in all others. The <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tai</span> in him will restrain all (spasmodic) loquacity. Those who are described in <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</cite> as "failing" are not to be thought of as bad men, men given up, as Julien has it, <i xml:lang="fr">au crime</i>. They are simply ordinary men, who have failed in their study of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> and practice of it, but are won to truth and virtue by the man whom the author has in mind. As we might expect, however, the mention of such men has much embarrassed the commentators.</p>
				    <p>Compare the concluding sentence with the one at the end of <cite><abbr>par.</abbr> 1 in <abbr>ch.</abbr> 17.</cite><a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-23" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
