					<p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">成象</span>, “The Completion of Material Forms.” This title rightly expresses the import of this enigmatical chapter; but there is a foundation laid in it for the development of the later Taoism, which occupies itself with the prolongation of life by the management of the breath (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">氣</span>) or vital force.</p>
					<p>“The valley” is used metaphorically as a symbol of “emptiness” or “vacancy;” and “the spirit of the valley” is the something invisible, yet almost personal, belonging to the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, which constitutes the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tê</span> (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">德</span>) in the name of our <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ching</i>. “The spirit of the valley” has come to be a name for the activity of the Tao in all the realm of its operation. “The female mystery” is the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> with a name of chapter 1, which is “the Mother of all things.” All living beings have a father and mother. The processes of generation and production can hardly be imaged by us but by a recognition of this fact; and so <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> thought of the existing realm of nature⁠—of life⁠—as coming through an evolution (not a creation) from the primal air or breath, dividing into two, and thence appearing in the forms of things, material and immaterial. The chapter is found in <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lieh-tzŭ</span> (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 1 b) quoted by him from a book of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huang-ti</span>; and here <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> has appropriated it, and made it his own.

He can by his management of his vital breath bring his body to the state of Taoistic perfection, and keep his intelligent and animal souls from being separated, and he can rule men without purpose and effort. “The gates of heaven” in <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-10-p-2"><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</a> is a Taoistic phrase for the nostrils as the organ of the breath;⁠—see the commentary of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung</span>. <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-45" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

He commences by calling it “a thing (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">物</span>);” but that term does not necessitate our regarding it as “material.” We have seen in the preceding chapter that it is used to signify “spirits and men.” Nor does his going on to speak of it as “chaotic (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">混成</span>)” necessarily lead us to conceive it as made up of the “material elements of things;” we have the same term applied in <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-14"><abbr>ch.</abbr> 14</a> to the three immaterial constituents there said to be blended in the idea of it.</p>

And to distinguish it from all other methods of evolution, he would call it “the Great Method,” and so he employs that combination as its name in <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-18"><abbr>ch.</abbr> 18</a> and elsewhere; but it cannot be said that this name has fully maintained it self in the writings of his followers. But understood thus, he here says, as in <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-1"><abbr>ch.</abbr> 1</a>, that it is “the Mother of all things.” And yet, when he says that “it was before Heaven and Earth were produced,” he comes very near his affirmations in <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-1">chapters 1</a> and <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-4">4</a>, that “the nameless <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> was the beginning (or originating cause) of Heaven and Earth,” and “might seem to have been before God.” Was he groping after God if haply he might find Him?

The other subordinate causes which he mentions all get their force or power from the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, but after all the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> is simply a spontaneity, evolving from itself, and not acting from a personal will, consciously in the direction of its own wisdom and love. “Who can by searching find out God?

					<p>The predicate of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> in the chapter, most perplexing to myself, is “<em>It</em> returns,” in <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-25-p-3"><abbr>par.</abbr>3</a>. “It flows away, far away, and comes back;”⁠—are not the three statements together equal to “It is everywhere?” <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-60" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The gist of the chapter is to be sought in the <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-36-p-2">second paragraph</a>, where we have two instances of the action of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> by contraries, supposed always to be for good.</p>
					<p>But there is a difficulty in seeing the applicability to this cases mentioned in <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-36-p-1"><abbr>par.</abbr> 1</a>. The first case, indeed is merely a natural phenomenon, having no moral character; but the others, as they have been illustrated from historical incidents, by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han Fei</span> and others at least, belong to schemes of selfish and unprincipled ambitious strategy, which it would be injurious to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> to suppose that he intended.</p>
					<p><a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-36-p-3"><abbr>Par.</abbr> 3</a> is the most frequently quoted of all the passages in our <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ching</i>, unless it be the first part of <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-1"><abbr>ch.</abbr> 1</a>. Fishes taken from the deep, and brought into shallow water, can be easily taken or killed; that is plain enough. “The sharp instruments of a state” are not its “weapons of war,” nor its “treasures,” nor its “instruments of government,” that is, its rewards and punishments, though this last is the interpretation often put on them, and sustained by a foolish reference to an incident, real or coined, in the history of the dukedom of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sung</span>.

These should not be shown to the people, whom the Taoistic system would keep in a state of primitive simplicity and ignorance. This interpretation is in accordance with the meaning of the characters, and with the general teaching of Taoism.

					<p>The “virtue” is the activity or operation of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, which is supposed to have come out of its absoluteness. Even <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han Fei</span> so defines it here⁠—“<i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tê</i> is the meritorious work of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>.”</p>
					<p>In <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-38-p-5"><abbr>par.</abbr> 5</a> we evidently have a resume of the preceding paragraphs, and, as it is historical, I translate them in the past tense; though what took place on the early stage of the world may also be said to go on taking place in the experience of every individual. With some considerable hesitation I have given the subjects in those paragraphs in the concrete, in deference to the authority of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung</span> and most other commentators. The former says, “By ‘the highest <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tê</span>’ is to be understood the rulers of the greatest antiquity, without name or designation, whose virtue was great, and could not be surpassed.” Most ingenious, and in accordance with the Taoistic system, is the manner in which <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wu Chʽêng</span> construes the passage, and I am surprised that it has not been generally accepted. By “the higher <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tê</span>” he understands, “the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>,” that which is prior to and above the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tê</span> (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">上德者, 在德之上, 道也</span>); by “the lower <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tê</span>,” benevolence, that which is after and below the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tê</span> which is above benevolence; by “the higher righteousness,” the benevolence which is above righteousness; and by “the higher propriety,” the righteousness which is above propriety. Certainly in the summation of these four paragraphs which we have in the fifth, the subjects of them would appear to have been in the mind of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> as thus defined by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wu</span>.</p>
					<p>In the reminder of the chapter he goes on to speak depreciatingly of ceremonies and knowledge, so that the whole chapter must be understood as descriptive of the process of decay and deterioration from the early time in which the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> and its attributes swayed the societies of men. <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-73" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

And the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> affords that law by its passionless, undemonstrative nature, through which in its spontaneity, doing nothing for the sake of doing, it yet does all things.</p>
					<p>The difficulty of translation is in the <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-39-p-3">third paragraph</a>. The way in which princes and kings speak depreciatingly of themselves in adduced as illustrating how they have indeed got the spirit of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>; and I accept the last epithet as given by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung</span>, “naveless” (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">轂</span>), instead of <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">穀</span> (= “the unworthy”), which is found in <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wang Pi</span>, and has been adopted by nearly all subsequent editors. To see its appropriateness here, we have only to refer back to <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-11">chapter 11</a>, where the thirty spokes, and the nave, empty to receive the axle, are spoken of, and it is shown how the usefulness of the carriage is derived from that emptiness of the nave.

So far therefore we have in this chapter a repetition of the lesson that “the movement of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> is by contraries,” and that its weakness is the sure precursor of strength. But the connection between this lesson and what he says in <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-42-p-1"><abbr>par.</abbr> 1</a> it is difficult to trace. Up to this time at least it has baffled myself. The passage seems to give us a cosmogony. “The <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> produced One.” We have already seen that the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> is “The One.” Are we to understand here that the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> and The One were one and the same? In this case what would be the significance of the <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">生</span> (“produced”)?⁠—that the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> which had been previously “non-existent” now became “existent,” or capable of being named? This seem to be the view of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ssŭ-ma Kuang</span> (<abbr class="era">AD</abbr> 1009⁠–⁠1086).</p>
					<p>The most singular form which this view assumes is in one of the treatises on our <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ching</i>, attributed to the Taoist patriarch <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lü</span> (<cite epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Hant">呂祖道德經解), that “the One is Heaven, which was formed by the congealing of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>.” According to another treatise, also assigned to the same <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lü</span> (<cite epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Hant">道德真經合解), the One was “the primordial ether;” the Two, “the separation of that into its Yin and Yang constituents;” and the Three, “the production of heaven, earth, and man by these.” In quoting the paragraph, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huai-nan Tzŭ</span> omits <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">道生一</span>, and commences with <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">一生二</span>, and his glossarist, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kao Yu</span>, makes out the One to be the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, the Two to be Spiritual Intelligences (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">神明</span>), and the Three to be the Harmonising Breath. From the mention of the Yin and Yang that follows, I believe that <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> intended by the Two these two qualities or elements in the primordial ether, which would be “the One.” I dare not hazard a guess as to what “the Three” were. <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-77" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">愛己</span>, “Loving one’s Self.” This title is taken from the expression in <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-72-p-4"><abbr>par.</abbr> 4</a>; and the object of the chapter seems to be to show how such loving should be manifested, and to enforce the lesson by the example of the “sage,” the true master of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>.</p>
					<p>In <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-72-p-1"><abbr>par.</abbr> 1</a> “the great dread” is death, and the things which ought to be feared and maybe feared, are the indulgences of the appetites and passions, which, if not eschewed, tend to shorten life and accelerate the approach of death.</p>

It gives a good meaning, and is supported by the structure of other sentences made on similar lines.</p>
					<p>In <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-72-p-4"><abbr>par.</abbr> 4</a> “the sage” must be “the ruler who is a sage,” a master of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, “the king” of <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-25"><abbr>ch.</abbr> 25</a>.

					<p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">任爲</span>. “Allowing Men to take their Course.” The chapter teaches that rulers should not be hasty to punish, especially by the infliction of death. Though they may seem to err in leniency, yet heaven does not allow offenders to escape.</p>
					<p>While heaven hates the ill-doer, yet we must not always conclude from its judgements that every one who suffers from them is an ill-doer; and the two lines which rhyme, and illustrate this point, are equivalent to the sentiment in our <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Old Book</i>, “Clouds and darkness are round about Him.” They are ascribed to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lieh-tzŭ</span> (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> 7 a); but, it has been said, that they are quoted by him “in an entirely different connection.” But the same text in two different sermons may be said to be in different connections.

					<p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">制惑</span>, “Restraining Delusion.” The chapter sets forth the inefficiency of capital punishment, and warns rulers against the infliction of it.

The answer of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung</span> is very clear:⁠—“It is Heaven, which, dwelling on high and ruling all beneath, takes note of the transgressions of men.” There is a slight variation in the readings of the second sentence of <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-74-p-2"><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</a> in the texts of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wang Pi</span>, and the reading adopted by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chiao Hung</span> differs a little from them both; but the meaning is the same in them all.</p>

The chapter is a warning for both rulers and people.</p>
					<p>It is not easy to determine whether rulers, or people or both, are intended in the concluding sentence of <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-75-p-2"><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</a>. <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-110" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">任契</span>, “Adherence to Bond or Covenant.” The chapter shows, but by no means clearly, how he who holds fast to the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> will be better off in the end than he who will rather try to secure his own interests.</p>
					<p><a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-79-p-1"><abbr>Par.</abbr> 1</a> presents us with a case which the statements of the chapter are intended to meet:⁠—two disputants, one good, and the other bad; the latter, though apparently reconciled, still retaining a grudge, and ready to wreak his dissatisfaction, when he has an opportunity.

					<p><a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-79-p-2"><abbr>Par.</abbr> 2</a> is intended to solve the question. The terms of a contract or agreement were inscribed on a slip of wood, which was then divided into two; each party having one half of it. At the settlement, if the halves perfectly fitted to each other, it was carried through. The one who had the right in the dispute has his part of the agreement, but does not insist on it, and is forbearing; the other insists on the conditions being even now altered in his favour. The characters by which this last case is expressed, are very enigmatical, having reference to the satisfaction of the government dues of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ’s</span> time⁠—a subject into which it would take much space to go.</p>
					<p><a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-79-p-3"><abbr>Par.</abbr> 3</a> decides the question by the action of heaven, which is only another name for the course of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>. <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-114" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">獨立</span>, “Standing Alone.” The chapter sets forth what <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> conceived the ancient government of simplicity was, and what he would have government in all time to be. He does not use the personal pronoun “I” as the subject of the thrice-recurring <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">使</span>, but it is most natural to suppose that he is himself that subject; and he modestly supposes himself in charge of a little state and a small population. The reader can judge for himself of the consummation that would be arrived at;⁠—a people rude and uninstructed, using quippos, abstaining from war and all travelling, kept aloof from intercourse even with their neighbours, and without the appliances of what we call civilisation.</p>

The author, says <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wu Chʽêng</span>, “sums up in this the subject-matter of the two parts of his treatise, showing that in all its five thousand characters, there is nothing beyond what is here said.”</p>

Those two characters primarily mean “sharpness” and “wounding by cutting;” they are also often used in the sense of “being beneficial,” and “being injurious;”⁠—“contraries,” both of them. Which “contrary” had <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao-tzŭ</span> in mind? I must think the former, though differing in this from all previous translators.
